<h2 align="center"> <u> HTML </u> </h2>

<p id="html"> An opening html tag should appear first and a closing /html tag should appear at the bottom of the document. Every other bit of HTML should appear between those two tags. The head element is the first element to appear after the opening html tag. In the document head we place things like the page title and meta data, we add JavaScript to our page with the script tag. All of the content that is visible on a web page is nested between opening and closing body tags. The body is the primary container of the content that makes up a web page. </p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> CSS </u> </h2>

<p id="css"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. </p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> JavaScript </u> </h2>

<p id ="javaScript"> JavaScript is a high level dynamic, untyped and interpreted programming language. JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages.JavaScript Can Change HTML Content, Attributes. </p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> jQuery </u> </h2>
<p id = "jQuery">jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
<p> 
.add()
Create a new jQuery object with elements added to the set of matched elements.<br>
</p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> AngularJS </u> </h2>
<p id="angularJS">AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a script tag.AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.It is a library written in JavaScript.AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag.<br>AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.<br>The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.<br>The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.<br>The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.
</p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> NodeJS </u> </h2>
<p id="NodeJS">Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done Node is sleeping.This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.</p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> GIT </u> </h2>
<p id="GIT"> Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.<br>
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer is Junio Hamano.<br>
As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.</p>

<h2 align="center"> <u> SourceTree </u> </h2>
<p id="sourceTree">SourceTree simplifies how you interact with your Git and Mercurial repositories so you can focus on coding. Visualize and manage your repositories through SourceTree's simple interface.<br>
