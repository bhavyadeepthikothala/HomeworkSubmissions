   html Element: An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page.Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text. Many HTML elements represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document.

6. What are the Semantic Elements? Describe about each one of them.
A) Many HTML tags have semantic meaning. That is, the element itself conveys some information about the type of content contained between the opening and closing tags. For example, when a browser encounters an h1 heading it interprets that tag to mean that the contents of the h1 element constitute the most important heading of the section that contains the element. The semantic meaning of an h1 tag is that it is used to identify the most important header of a specific web page or section.
Eg: <h1> to <h6>, <form>, <li>

Here is the list of the semantic elements that are added  as a part of html5
